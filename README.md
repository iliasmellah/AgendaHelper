# Agenda Helper - Alexa Skill

Alexa skill that helps 5th year IT and Management Polytech Montpellier students to get info about their schedule or the weather. This project was made as part of the Web Intelligence course in 2019 with Mr CASTELLTORT Arnaud.

In order to create our skill, we used :
 - Alexa Developer Console : create our intents, slots and make tests
 - Lambda Management Console : create our functions, implement our intents and add our layers
 - CloudWatch Management Console : check our logs
 - Alexa SKill Code Generator : create a clean code from our Alexa console to our Lambda console
